### About Me

##### Hello! My name is Jonah. Welcome to my GitHub page, it's great to have you here ðŸ˜ƒ
##### Transitioning from animation into coding has been really great and rewarding so far! Frontend development, especially working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has been really enjoyable as well.
##### I would love to continue to expand my skills in web development through more projects-- especially collaborative ones!
##### Aside from coding, I really enjoy rock climbing and Dungeons and Dragons! [Feel free to add me on LinkedIn if you do too ðŸ˜Ž](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonah-cj-park/)
